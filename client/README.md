## 🌍 Overview

**Dropgate Client** is the desktop way to upload and share files through a Dropgate Server.
It’s built to feel simple: pick a file, choose your options, hit upload, and share the link.


## ✨ Features

* 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** | Encrypt on your device before upload, decrypt on the recipient’s device. The server doesn’t need your key.

* 🌐 **Server Agnostic** | Connect to any compatible Dropgate Server — whether it’s self-hosted at home, deployed via Docker, or behind a reverse proxy.

* 🧱 **Privacy by Design** | No telemetry, no analytics, and no personal identifiers. Your data stays between you and your chosen server.

* 🖥️ **Cross-Platform Support** | Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

* 📦 **Multi-File Uploads** | Select or drag-and-drop multiple files at once — they're bundled together and uploaded in one go.

* ⚡ **Fast, Lightweight Interface** | Simple drag-and-drop UI focused on minimalism and clarity.

* 🧩 **Smart Compatibility Checks** | The client reads server capabilities (limits, encryption support, etc.) so you don’t run into surprises mid-upload.

* 🪟 **Windows Context Menu Integration** | Right-click a file and upload in the background.


## 📦 Installation

To install Dropgate Client:

1. Download the latest release for your OS from the [releases page](https://github.com/diamonddigitaldev/Dropgate/releases).
2. Extract or install the app as you would any other desktop app.
3. Launch the client and connect to your preferred server.


## 🚀 Usage

### Sending a file

1. **Launch** the client.
2. **Enter the server address** you want to connect to (for example, your home server or a private Dropgate instance).
3. **Select a file** to upload (or drag and drop it into the window).
4. **Choose your options** (E2EE is auto-applied when available, file lifetime, etc.).
5. **Hit upload!** When it finishes, the **download link is copied to your clipboard**.

**Protip (Windows):** Right-click a file and choose **"Share with Dropgate"** to upload in the background. E2EE is auto-applied when available; if not, you'll see a warning.

### Receiving a file

1. Open your web browser.
2. Paste the download link into the address bar.
3. Download as usual. If the file is end-to-end encrypted, decryption happens locally on your device.


## 🌐 Direct Transfer (P2P)

The desktop client focuses on the classic hosted-upload flow.
If your server has **Direct Transfer (P2P)** enabled, you can use it from the server’s **Web UI** in your browser.


## 🛠️ Development

To set up a development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diamonddigitaldev/Dropgate.git
cd Dropgate/client
npm install
npm start
```


## 🏗️ Building

To build the client for your platform:

```bash
npm run build
```

Distributable binaries will appear in the `dist` folder.


## 🔌 Self-Hosting & Networking

Dropgate Client works seamlessly with **self-hosted Dropgate Servers**, which you can run from your own **home server**, **NAS**, or **cloud VPS**.

It plays nicely with common setups like:

* 🌐 **NGINX** or **Caddy** reverse proxies
* ☁️ **Cloudflare Tunnel**
* 🔒 **Tailscale** private networks
