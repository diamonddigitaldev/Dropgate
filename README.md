## 🌐 Public Demo

See **Dropgate** in action here: **[dropgate.link](https://dropgate.link)**

To prevent and monitor for abuse, `DEBUG`-level logging and strict rate limits are enforced.

## 🌍 Overview

**Dropgate** is a modern, privacy-respecting file sharing system designed to be easy to self-host and easy to use.

It ships as three parts:
- [**Dropgate Client**](./client/README.md): A lightweight Electron app for uploading, encrypting, and sharing files.
- [**Dropgate Server**](./server/README.md): A Node.js backend that hosts the API + Web UI, with optional end-to-end encryption and configurable storage.
- [**@dropgate/core**](./packages/dropgate-core/README.md): A headless TypeScript library that powers the client and server, usable in custom projects.

Dropgate supports **two ways to transfer files**:
- **Hosted upload (classic mode)** — you upload to your server, share a link, and the server holds the file temporarily.
- **Direct transfer (P2P)** — the file can move device-to-device, with the server only helping peers find each other.

In today’s world, privacy and anonymity are more important than ever.
Dropgate was built to make **secure file sharing accessible**, **transparent**, and **fully self-hostable** — whether on a home NAS, a VPS, or in Docker.


## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** – Encrypt on the sender device, decrypt on the recipient device. Encryption keys never need to reach the server.
- 🕵️ **Privacy First** – No analytics, no tracking, and no logging of file contents.
- 🔗 **Share Links That “Just Work”** – Simple links for recipients that expire based on download count or lifetime.
- 🚀 **Direct Transfer (P2P)** – Great for big files or “zero-storage” sharing (when enabled).
- 🧩 **Built-in Web UI** – Send and receive from a browser, no install required.
- ⚙️ **Configurable Server Controls** – Tune size limits, rate limits, retention, and storage caps.
- 🧰 **Self-Host Ready** – Works behind common reverse proxies and tunnels.

## 🔒 Privacy and Security Philosophy

Dropgate’s design is built around **you staying in control of your data**:

* E2EE means even the server operator can’t read encrypted uploads.
* Hosted uploads are intended to be temporary (downloaded and/or expired, then removed).
* Direct transfer can avoid server storage entirely (when enabled).

If you self-host, you decide how strict you want to be — from private-only to public-facing with limits.
